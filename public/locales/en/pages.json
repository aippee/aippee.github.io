      "paragraph1": "I am a psychologist whose passion is helping people build satisfying and loving relationships. I have served hundreds of clients, couples and individuals, and helped them towards mutually defined goals.",
      "paragraph2": "In my client work, I am warm and empathetic, and I want to create a safe space for clients to explore their backgrounds, feelings and experiences.",
      "paragraph3": "I believe it's important that client work is based on researched and effective tools, but at the same time we always start from goals that are important to you and thought through together.",
      "paragraph4": "In my couples therapy work, I rely strongly on the Emotionally Focused Therapy framework, which is the world's most researched and effective form of couples therapy. In individual sessions, I often combine emotion-focused and cognitive-analytical tools with a short-term therapeutic approach."

      "description1": "Couples therapy processes are usually between 3-10 sessions, but more sessions can be arranged according to need. You can also start with a 20-minute introductory session with me if you want to first try what it feels like to talk about relationship matters.",
      "description2": "You can come to couples therapy to work on, for example, feelings of distance, recurring conflicts, disagreements related to values or differences of opinion, trust-related challenges, or themes of sexuality and intimacy. In couples therapy work, I utilize the Emotionally Focused Therapy framework, which is the world's most researched and effective couples therapy framework."

Short-term therapy sessions are usually anything from a few sessions to a half-year or even year-long process. You can make more detailed plans with me once we get started with the sessions.",
      "description2": "In short-term therapy, you can work through matters that weigh on your mind with me. You can get support from sessions for, for example, a burdensome life situation, challenges in relationships or partnerships, or anxiety or depressive symptoms that interfere with your life. You can also come to sessions if you want to understand yourself or some of your behavioral patterns better, or make changes in your life in the direction you desire."
