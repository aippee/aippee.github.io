    "You were good at creating better understanding between us. You do really good work as a psychologist and we were both very satisfied. You were good at keeping the conversation on track and bringing up the emotional side and understanding towards each other.",
    "You were really approachable and effortlessly created an atmosphere where it was easy to discuss anything.",
    "Basically everything: we only had a 3-session package, but we got a good grip on important relationship themes and learned new things about ourselves and our partner. This despite the fact that we already communicate a lot in our relationship.",
    "The therapist suited both of us well and created a safe and peaceful atmosphere for the sessions. A better connection was built between us and that felt important."
